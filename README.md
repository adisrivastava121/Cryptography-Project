We introduce Classification of binary codes on basis of single dele-
tion correcting code in this paper. We also looked upon Varshamov-
Tenengolts code for basic understanding of how single deletion works

on binary codes classified through Varshamov-Tenengolts code . Our

general result might have more applications/implications in informa-
tion theory, computer science, and mathematics.
