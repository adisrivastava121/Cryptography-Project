We introduce Classification of binary codes on basis of single deletion correcting code in this paper. We also looked upon Varshamov-Tenengolts code for basic understanding of how single deletion works on binary codes classified through Varshamov-Tenengolts code . Our general result might have more applications/implications in information theory, computer science, and mathematics.
